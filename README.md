# Graph Lab

### Overview
We are going to build a simple app to tell students the walking time and distance between various locations on campus. We will use a **graph** data structure to model the relationships between destinations (or "nodes") and to perform necessary distance / time calculations.

[Here is a live demo]() of the app you are going to build. Try it out to see it in action.

### Instructions

#### I. Develop Context 
Read over the following notes and answer the associated questions in a separate document (paper, Google Doc, markdown, etc.). 

   1. [Graph Basics](Notes/1-GraphBasics.md)
   2. [Classes](Notes/2-Classes.md). 
   3. [Dijkstra's Algorithm](Notes/3-Dijkstras.md)

#### II. Implement Dijkstra's Algorithm 
Follow the steps outlined [here](Notes/4-Implementation.md) to implement Dijkstra's algorithm and complete the Cate Map App.

When you are done, you should have a working app. Submit the code
